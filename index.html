         <p>Yes, you read that right. I love, love, LOVE red beans, sausage, and rice as a dish. It's something I grew up on, being raised by my cajun mother and I make it from time to time for my own children. Nothing brings me back to my childhood quite like it and it's a way for me to connect with my family roots in Louisiana. Before I get into what I love about it, I'll let you in on a little history about this particular dish...</p>

            <h2>Quick history of red beans, sausage, and rice</h2>
         </header>
         <p>Red beans and rice has its beginning in the southern United States, particularly in New Orleans, Louisiana. Historically, it was made on Mondays during wash day utilizing parts of Sunday dinner to mix in and create a nice, savory meal. It was also known as a good meal to make during Catholic lent&mdash;a time when Catholics abstain from eating meat&mdash;sans any meat. Typically, people make this meal with any variation of pork, however it's been known to be prepared with any sort of meat one happens to be in the mood to eat that day.</p>

            <p>Now, let's get into what makes this meal so darn delicious! For one, the red beans makes the meal what it really is. Without the flavor from red beans, you won't get the full effect. It just gives you a texture that goes really well with the rice.</p>

               <h2>Rice</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The rice is a foundation of this dish. Typically made with white rice, it can be cooked separate from the beans and meat, but it can also be cooked with them and taste just as good, if not better (depends on the mood, really).</p>

               <h2>Sausage</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Lastly, the sausage. Now, I prefer smoked sausage cut into medallions, but this is truly a preference chosen by the one making and/or eating it. The rice and beans go really well together, but something about the sausage brings it all together and adds a little more mm-mm-MMM!! I like to make it with just a bit of pepper, onions, celery, peppers, and garlic, but minimally it can be made nicely with onions and pepper alone.</p>
